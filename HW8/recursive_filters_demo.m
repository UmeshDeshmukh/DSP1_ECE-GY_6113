%% Recursive digital filters
% This demo illustrates the classic filters:
% Butterworth, Chebyshev 1 & 2, and Elliptic.
%
% Compared to FIR filters, recursive filters of low-order
% have improved magnitude response (but they do not have
% linear phase).

%% Butterworth filter

clear

[b, a] = butter(3, 0.4);
% filter order: 3 (3 poles, 3 zeros)
% cut-off frequency: 0.2 cycles/sample
% Note: Matlab uses non-conventional scaling of 
% frequency (0.4 instead of 0.2 here).

%%
% Note that the magnitude response is flat at both
% dc and the Nyquist frequency (0.5).
% There are no ripples. The response is monotonic.

[H, om] = freqz(b, a);
f = om/(2*pi);
